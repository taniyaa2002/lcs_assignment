# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Algorithm in C/C++

This repository contains an implementation of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm in C/C++. The program calculates the length of the LCS between two input strings uding dynamic programming technique.

## Key Features

- Implements the LCS algorithm using a bottom-up dynamic programming technique.
- Handles various input scenarios including empty strings and different lengths efficiently.

## Implementation Details

The program initializes a 2D array to store LCS lengths for subproblems and iteratively computes the LCS length based on character matches between the input strings.
